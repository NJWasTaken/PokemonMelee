## üìã Project Description

**PokemonMelee** is a Pok√©mon battle game built in Python. Players engage in turn-based battles where they can attack, emote, scan Pok√©mon stats, or run. Our implementation combines GUI elements with database management, ensuring an engaging user experience.

- **Battle Screen:** Execute attacks, emote during battles, scan player and Pok√©mon stats, and retreat to the home screen.
- **End Screen:** Displays game results with options to replay or exit.

### Technical Highlights

- GUI created using **pygame** and **tkinter**.
- Database management using **pandas** and CSV files.
- Modular programming with a custom module `pokedex.py` for Pok√©mon data.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for game mechanics.
- Cross-platform compatibility using the `os` module.
